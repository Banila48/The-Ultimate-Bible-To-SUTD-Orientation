<h1>This document is separated into the following parts in order:</h1>

  <br> Plot + Theme </br>
  <br> T-Shirt (Quotations + Estimated numbers) </br>
  <br> Preparation up until Orientation itself </br>

<h1> Plot + Theme </h1>
<p>Theme is the earliest thing to decide. If possible, discuss with your subcomm first to come up with a few ideas (with some story/interesting feature), AND THEN discuss with your fellow directors.
OSL is open to all the ideas as long as it is sensible (as politically correct as possible), but they will take some time to read and approve the initial proposal. </p>

<p>These are themes that has been done before (you can find it on Facebook by finding the SUTD Orientation Pages)</p>
<br> 2017 Into The Grid (set in space, race to be the first house to achieve the alien technology prize)
<br> 2018 Dust Till Dawn (Post apocalyptic, race to leave the underground bunkers to surface for safety)
<br> 2019 Oletrhos (Also in space, race to secure precious materials while thinking Earth was destroyed but actually wasn’t)
<br> I think one of the previous years did something on Pirates and another on Wizards/Magic etc


<p> You don’t have to be hard pressed to have the theme be related to technology just because it’s SUTD (do the theme that you WANT to work with, else you’ll dread working) </p>

<p> For orientation, the story is not 100% the focus of every incoming freshie. Remember that orientation is FOR THE incoming students, not yourself, so try not to do story with a lot of details (also 3 days is not a lot of time to set up the story properly)
</p>

<p>Do up your first proposal draft as early as you can and go through with it with your Heads. The earlier you submit the proposal, the more time you have to prepare the more aesthetic parts (videos)
</p>

<h1>T-Shirt + Quotations </h1>
This is the biggest hassle of CM. 

<p>Designs will take time to be done up by your subcomm so assign the responsibilities early and give sufficient time for them to think it up (around 1 month etc). Check in on them regularly and hold meetings to clarify questions (it would be best if you already have a certain direction of design in mind – such as wanting weapons or animals as the designs, or a certain form of aesthetic like geometric figures etc) (it’s okay if you don’t, but hold regular meetings so your artists [that is if your subcomm is designing instead of you] are all clear and on the same page)
</p>
<p>The folder should have all the designs on it. </p>

<p>The designs you need are:
Theme shirt (1), House shirts (depending on how many houses you want/OSL wants – Closer to the date, depending on the estimated numbers, OSL may dictate the number of houses, so have more designs ready in case of that), OGL Shirt (1), Subcomm Shirt (1), Camp Exec Shirt (1)
If you want to have more shirts, it is possible (though you need to make sure finance adds up, and you can justify the inclusion of a new shirt) </p>


<p>Later in the preparation stage, these are the OSL given numbers for ordering of the shirts  FOR FRESHIES (account for OGL numbers separately)
<br> XS: 35
<br> S: 110
<br> M: 200
<br L: 70
<br> XL: 30
<br> XXL: 5

<p>Prepare the designs early because the quotations will take forever to be approved. You need at least 3 weeks for the shirt printing company to complete the entire order. 
For 2019 Orientation, the shirt vendor CM went with was Trendink </p>

<h1>Preparation Up Till Orientation </h1>

<p> Namely, videos. Work closely and make friends with the Productions people because you will need their cooperation. Plan what you want to film, have a really fking clear plan with all the actions and the gestures and the sound everything planned out. Meet one of them to at least dry run once to make sure actual filming will have little hiccups. </p>

<br>
<br>
<p>Don’t slack. While there doesn’t seem to have a lot to do for CM, it isn’t an excuse to slack (I did this and shit went down). Orientation on the actual day itself will have its own fkfest so it’ll be good for you to step up during the actual day </p>

<p>For subcomm hiring, you actually do not need a lot of people (I had 8 and it was too many people). Have dedicated people for the tech side of stuff (website, telegram bots), designs (for shirts and other animation you might require later), and for story (you need to know this by heart, have one or 2 more to help with fleshing out the story) </p>
