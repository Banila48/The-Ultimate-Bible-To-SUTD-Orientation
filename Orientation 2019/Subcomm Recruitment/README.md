#### Pre-Interview

After the whole O Comm team was ready, we sent out an application form <attached> to find the subcommittee members. This google form was distributed via school email as well as posters around the school. 

PS: You need to find someone who can design the poster.


The form consists of the specifications of various jobscopes. 

After a certain period of time, we closed the form and sent out another set of google forms to these potential candidates for their interview availability.

We sort the interview days/slots based on the candidates' preferred committee. This way, the respective director would only need to stay for certain time window on certain day(s). Thus, what we did was to send out different set of forms with different available time slots respectively.

Also, another attached file is how I allocate specific interview slot based on the candidates' availability. (I think it was quite efficient so I have attached it on top)

In addition, a few days before the interview process started, I asked each director to prepare a set of questions they want to ask. And you need to think of a venue where to conduct the interview + do the booking if necessary.


#### Interview Processs
The interviewer panel consisted of at least 3 people - the 2 Project Directors as well as the respective committee director.

Before the interview process starts, you should have prepared a google doc consisting of the interviewees responses + an empty column to jot down their responses during the interview. The important questions to ask were their commitment level as well as their awareness of the jobscope. (This is because some people might be confused to whether they can double-role both subcommittee member and OGL, the answer is no).

As to how strict the interview process should be, it is up to you to set the tone (also depends on the number of google form responses)



#### Post-Interview
This one is pretty straightforward. Send out notification message (for those who got rejected) and can just invite the rest to respective committee directly.
