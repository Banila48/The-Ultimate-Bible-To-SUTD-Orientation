### Should you treat this as an avenue to try out games with larger size of participants?
My advice is try not to treat this Dry Run 1 as an avenue to test out all the games with large size of participants, but rather, this
DR1 should be the first time that the Progs/Logs people **get accustomed to setting up and tearing down of game stations within a limited amount of time.**

### How ready should the games and the people in-charge be?
- This would be the first time for game masters to 'man' their stations.
- Progs people who are in-charge of the games are expected to be ready with intructional script/presentation materials for the game masters to carry out the game.
- The challenge that you may face would be both progs, logs as well as the game masters are unfamiliar with their own games. Thus, it is your job to ensure that they have studied the game details beforehand. (This includes, but not limited to, the duration of buffer time and gameplay, rules and scores to be given out).
- And I personally believe the only way to test the waters would be to ask them one by one questions about the details of their own game(s).
- These questions can be open-ended which are meant for the progs people to decide (e.g Should you carry out the game XXX way? Is the main goal of this station to have the freshies to have fun? Or should we let them have fun through competition with the other OG?).
- Alternatively, you should also ask questions regarding more serious facts such as 'What is the maximum number of players that you allow each round? How are you gonna ensure that every single person from the OG gets to play the game? and etc)
- On the actual DR itself, you can sit aside and watch how the game masters carry out the games. Watch out for the way they carry themselves as at the end of the day, freshies should be hyped up by these game masters.
- Remind game masters that asking the participants to cheer for them for extra points are one of the ways to enliven their stations.

### Can we modify the games after this dry run?
- Yes. Actually DR1 is meant for the pilot run of your games.
- The games are, of course, open to changes based on the feedback given. This then brings us to the point of how you should always gather feedback (can be from survey through google forms throughout the day to prevent backlog of schedules as well as post dry run discussion with the people more directly involved).
- However, if you are using this DR to pilot test the game for the **first time**, this means that you are wasting one opportunity to try out your matrix movement as well as other details that can only be experienced through day-long event.
- My advice is to:
  - Try out the games internally amongst the progs/logs people
  - Once the games are kinda ready, get the progs people to prepare scripts for game masters.
  - Let them introduce the games to respective game masters. Then let the game masters re-enact how the games should be carried out.
  - All of the above must be done ideally before the actual DR1.
- Thus, you can train these same people to do all these under time constraints and prevent backlog in the set schedule.
