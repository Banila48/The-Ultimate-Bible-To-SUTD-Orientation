      * Determine that information collected is the same as the given initial reports

      * Also found a space station left behind by the humans of the past with huge cache of information about the terrain and geography of the planet, proving to be valuable in hinting the factions on the best areas to take control first/most resource concentrated areas

  * All the factions infiltrated the abandoned independently, now the race to see who will gather the most information first
  * Space station has a security function, which was triggered when the factions entered. They now have to find their way out while avoiding the built in security function of the space station (the robots patrolling are NOT endroids, just security features of the space station)
  * At the same time, while solving their clues, they find that some people are reporting extra useless stuff to thwart their efforts in solving. This points to the existence of traitors within
  * [tentative?] There will be extra clues prepared in a different colour that corresponds to the endroid log puzzles, which will be made available once a certain checkpoint is met (checkpoint to be confirmed)
