### Orientation Welfare Director
As the name suggests, you and your team are to look after the welfare of the freshmores, the OGLs, and the entire Orientation planning committee. Our motto is Stay Safe, Stay Hydrated, Stay Woke! Be it morale, health, well-being, you and your **welfairies** are entrusted with the task of keeping these 3 aspects high. 

As welfare director, there are a couple of things from my experience that I feel are very important. Firstly, you need to be very bonded with your subcommittee and always bring fun to the table. During Orientation, its going to be very hectic and people will start getting angsty or tilted, so the Welfare team has to come in and really boost morale or liven things up. Welfare Director, no matter how shag, must still smile and joke around to ease tension, but still be very aware of the things you need to do (first aid, scheduling etc) Secondly, you need to except that SUTD’s Welfare will never be the same as other uni’s welfare such as Gongcha, ice cream etc because of the lack of budget. Most often, Welfare will have to tank any budget cuts or contingencies. For our year, because programmes and logistics exceeded budget by quite a bit, Welfare was the one that absorbed the damage and had to forgo many Welfare items we wanted. Thirdly, Welfare subcomm will have to support in a lot of non-Welfare related stuff during Orientation, meaning your subcomm might have to help out other comms do their jobs due to lack of manpower. 

#### Job scope: Food, Ambulance, Safety, OGLs, OGL Booklet, Housing, Incident report


**Outline of SUTD Orientation 2019:** My team was split into smaller comms as per job scope. I had 1 in charge of ambulance and first aid, 2 for food, 1 for OGL Handbook, and 4 for OGLs (1 per house), the rest was done by me. Everyone had their own job to do and as Welfare Director, I oversaw everything but empowered my team to make decisions on my behalf. I think the most important thing is to make them feel safe working with you, in the sense that give them full autonomy to make decisions (of course they will usually discuss with me as well) but if anything goes wrong, I would take the arrow. 

### Subcommittee members
I didn’t get to choose my subcommittee members but was very lucky to have very solid and fun people to work with. I guess choosing people for any comm is the same, you want people who you know can do work, people you can work with well, and people you can have fun with. 

### Food
Things to note: 
1.	All food items (usually above $300) must have 3 quotations from 3 different vendors. For every meal item (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, Buffet, Drinks, other food related welfare), you need to prepare a Purchase Award Form (PAF) along with the 3 quotations. Check that all orders are **comparable** (will explain in point 2), and that **delivery dates, timing, location, billing address and payment method** are all the same.
2.	All orders must be comparable, meaning there must be a common yardstick to base the selection of which vendor we going for. Eg. If we were to order lunch, we **either fix the price at $3** and compare which vendor can provide a better deal at that price, or we would ask for **same dishes** (1 staple, 1 meat, 1 veg, 1 side) and compare the price which is usually the case.
3.	Bonus items are not part of the comparison. For our year, several drink vendors were willing to give us free cartons for every X number of cartons ordered. These free of charge cartons are not to be taken into account while doing the comparison. Eg.Let’s say you need 200 cartons of drink. If vendor A provides 1 free carton for every 10 cartons ordered, while vendor B does not, in  your quotation, you still need to request 200 cartons from A as well as 200 cartons from B. This will leave you with total of 220 cartons if you were to go with A or 200 cartons if you go with B.
4.	The numbers to order for each meal will only come in very late (a few days before Orientation), but that doesn’t mean you don’t source for vendors early. There are still deadlines from OSL to source for food quotations, but you will use arbitrary numbers. Your team will find themselves constantly calling and emailing the vendors to amend quotations based on our very volatile numbers and requests. Suggestion would be to visit their website and pretend to order online. Once you reach the confirmation page, don’t submit your order, but just screenshot the menu along with all necessary details and provide it to OSL for approval. This counts as a quotation as well.

Meals to cover
* Breakfast	
  * Usually bread (Cream rolls). Source from standard companies like Gardenia, Sunshine, Best One. 

* Muslim Breakfast (if necessary)	
  * Muslim club in SUTD will recommend a vendor. Need to still find 3 quotations with comparable breakfast. Best is to get a muslim representative to settle this on your behalf.
  
* Lunch, Dinner and Drinks
  * Very straightforward. Usually does not deviate from past years. 1 staple, 1 meat, 1 veg, 1 side for around $3. You guys get to choose the menu.
	

### Ambulance and First Aid
Ambulance quotation is very similar to food, in that you need at least 3 quotations from 3 suppliers. Their rates per hour, AED pads, and hospital evacuations usually vary so it’s hard to find a basis. How my team evaluated is based on a specific scenario (15hrs standby for all games timing, 2 AED pads usage and 2 hospital evacuations) then we compared the overall pricing and chose the one that is cheapest. SEAS Pte Ltd is a vendor that we have always used and OSL generally trusts them more due to past incidents.
All welfare subcommittee members will be required to attend first aid course. It would do you good if you have at least one very strong first aider to cover most situations.

### OGL Handbook
This is fairly straightforward as we already have a template that has been revised and modified every year, so you can just use the one from 2019 and make necessary changes. OGL Handbook is not very important in my opinion but is very useful in the event an OGL doesn’t know what to do, which shouldn’t happen.

### OGL
OGL is usually the most problematic because it deals with people. Seniors who have more experience, who have been through more SUTD Orientations, seniors who are very vocal and have a very strong mindset. It’s really about building trust with them and trying to keep them happy but in check. For my year, I introduced a new system of having 4 OGL ICs within my subcomm to manage to OGLs of each house.

**OGL Selection:** It is a shit show and no matter who you accept, there will be people who talk behind your back about you. There will be a lot of people who want to be OGL because it is fun. My only word of advice is to be clear on what kind of people you want. For every interview slot, I made sure I was present, at least 2 of my OGL ICs and 1 Project Director were present. Ultimately the choice of who you select is up to your committee.

**OGL Management:** With each subcomm IC in charge of one house, it was very easy for me to coordinate everything as I had one point of contact for each house and they would settle most of the ground work for me. The thing about being a director in Orientation is that you shouldn’t do all the work yourself, but oversee everything and take charge when there are issues to settle. Try to come up with a timeline on when you need things to get done. OGLs usually leave all house admin matters to the few days before Orientation. This is alright as long as things get done. Do expect a lot of them to not reply or ghost until leading up to Orientation, many are there to join in the fun, but might not be reliable.

### Housing
Housing is very convenient during Orientation and most people involved would want housing during Orientation period. You can create a Microsoft forms to collect responses for housing but it would be good to assume everyone requires housing (just to be safe) and constantly pester them to respond. This prepares for cases where OGLs blatantly do not read the chat and did not respond but still want housing.

### During Orientation
Welfare has the toughest time during Orientation because there are so many aspects of it to oversee. Ensure that food, first aid, OGL management is sufficiently covered to ensure smooth running. You need to know what is going on at every single point in time and communicate it to the Project Directors. 
Matriculation Day: Due to the Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA), the freshmore list will only be shared with Welfare head and possibly 1 Project Director. You are in charge of allocating the freshmores who did not submit their Orientation form in time to an OG based on their class (of course this depends on the system of class allocation)

Some tips: 
1.	First aid. Every injury case will require a report to OSL, even if it’s just a small abrasion on the elbow or knee, OSL needs to know. Carry your laptop/tablet around with you. Whenever someone gets injured or goes to see the paramedics, get them to fill in the incident report form and log sheet immediately, so you don’t have to worry about it and chase the freshies who will not reply for it when school starts. 
2.	Morale. It will be very tiring for everyone so whatever it is, you must always put on a smile and make jokes to liven the mood, be it for your O comm, subcomm or towards the freshies.
3.	Freshies. The entire welfare subcomm will not be involved so much in interacting with the freshmores which is something you have to accept. Doing first aid duty and handling the backend miscellaneous stuff is boring, but your duty as Welfare Director comes first. Having fun is important but just do not let it distract you from what you are supposed to do.

Last piece of advice is don’t be too hard on yourself when things go wrong, just react and try to remedy it accordingly. Work closely with your Orientation committee and friends to ensure things go smoothly. Make lots of memories during Orientation itself and just enjoy the ride 😊 

All the best,
